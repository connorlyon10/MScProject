# Wav2Vec2 Project

This project implements a speech-to-text transcription system using the Wav2Vec2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is initialized with pre-trained weights and is capable of transcribing audio files into text.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wav2vec2-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`. After activating your environment, run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the transcription application, execute the following command:

```
python src/main.py <path_to_audio_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_audio_file>` with the path to the audio file you wish to transcribe.

## Wav2Vec2 Model

The Wav2Vec2 model is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This project utilizes a pre-trained version of the model, which allows for effective transcription without the need for additional training.
