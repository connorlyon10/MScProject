# Real-Time Transcription and Speaker Recognition from Multi-Speaker Audio

## Overview
This is the project README. I aim to update it as progress is made.



## Repository Structure
- `thesis/` – LaTeX source for the thesis document. The PDF will also be in here.
- `src/` – Source code.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA.



## Current Progress
- Pre-reading, Project planning and repo structuring.
- Preliminary experiments in `notebooks/`. Code developed here will eventually belong in `src/`.

## To-Do - ASAP
- Gantt Chart (or similar - Notion or Trello)
- Initial data collection
- Complete notebooks demonstrating that a pipeline is possible
- Literature Review write-up (?)

## To-Do - Later on..
- Convert dev code (from notebooks) to prod code in `src/`.
- Create a (simple!) web server to host an app
- DEMO: Basic front-end that accepts an input sound file (drop-down menu of 5 options) and gives an output (who said it and what was said). This should include one 'real' observation (a sound recording by me!)
- After Demo, attempt real-time conversion on the server...
